/*!
 * \brief A symbol represents a named value or location in memory that may be defined at most once.
 * 
 * Symbols provided by this namespace are meant to be flexibile--supporting microprogrammin and ELF usage.
 * 
 * Symbols that are undefined after linkage should cause an error; symbols defined multiple times should cause
 * immediate errors.
 * Some examples of symbol values are: currently undefined (symbol::empty), an address of a line of code
 * (symbol::value_location), or a numeric constant (symbol::value_const)
 * 
 * As this class exposes all of its data publicly, it is up to the user to ensure that properties such as binding
 * and definition state are updated correctly.
 * This API decision was made because it is impossible for a symbol to know if its value is being set because it is defined,
 * or if the value is being set to handle relocation.
 * Simply put, the symbol doesn't know enough to update these fields.
 * 
 * \tparam value_t An unsigned integral type that is large enough to contain the largest address on the target system.
