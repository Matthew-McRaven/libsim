/*
 * At this point in the project, I needed some humor.
 * The methods and classes described in this file are responsible for turning our IR into an ELF binary.
 * That is, this code creates elves.
 * 
 * According to LoTR mythology, the supreme being Eru Il√∫vatar creates elf-kind from his thoughts.
 * Seeing as both this code and Eru are in the business of making elves, it seemed fitting to name the code after Eru.
 * See: https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar
